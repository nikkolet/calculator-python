<h2 align="center">What?</h2>
A calculator application with the option to choose the layout to match your favorite Hogwarts house at the touch of a button on the top left corner. The calculator will be able to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
<h2 align="center">Why?</h2>
<b>Purpose: </b>Many people use calculators daily to solve problems at school, work, and grocery stores. Many people are also huge Harry Potter fans like me, but there is no calculator where they can show off their Hogwarts house while they solve math problems. This application serves as a remedy and will have you J.K. Rolling through your math equations in no time.

<b>Quote</b>
<br>
Below the application will be a quote from the sorting hat concerning the characteristics of those sorted into that house.
<br>
<br>
<ui>
  <li>You might belong in <b>Gryffindor</b>, where dwell the brave at heart. Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.</li>
  <li>You might belong in <b>Hufflepuff</b>, where they are just and loyal. Those patient Hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil.</li>
  <li>Yet in wise old <b>Ravenclaw</b> if you've a ready mind, where those of wit and learning will always find their kind.</li>
  <li>Perhaps in <b>Slytherin</b> you'll make your real friends. Those cunning folks use any means to achieve their ends.</li>
</ui>
